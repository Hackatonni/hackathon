        "abstract": "  We contrast two sets of conditions that govern the transition in which\nclassical dynamics emerges from the evolution of a quantum system. The first\nwas derived by considering the trajectories seen by an observer (dubbed the\n``strong'' transition) [Bhattacharya, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85: 4852\n(2000)], and the second by considering phase-space densities (the ``weak''\ntransition) [Greenbaum, et al., Chaos 15, 033302 (2005)]. On the face of it\nthese conditions appear rather different. We show, however, that in the\nsemiclassical regime, in which the action of the system is large compared to\n$\\hbar$, and the measurement noise is small, they both offer an essentially\nequivalent local picture. Within this regime, the weak conditions dominate\nwhile in the opposite regime where the action is not much larger than Planck's\nconstant, the strong conditions dominate.\n",

        "abstract": "  The extreme statistics of time signals is studied when the maximum is\nmeasured from the initial value. In the case of independent, identically\ndistributed (iid) variables, we classify the limiting distribution of the\nmaximum according to the properties of the parent distribution from which the\nvariables are drawn. Then we turn to correlated periodic Gaussian signals with\na 1/f^alpha power spectrum and study the distribution of the maximum relative\nheight with respect to the initial height (MRH_I). The exact MRH_I distribution\nis derived for alpha=0 (iid variables), alpha=2 (random walk), alpha=4 (random\nacceleration), and alpha=infinity (single sinusoidal mode). For other,\nintermediate values of alpha, the distribution is determined from simulations.\nWe find that the MRH_I distribution is markedly different from the previously\nstudied distribution of the maximum height relative to the average height for\nall alpha. The two main distinguishing features of the MRH_I distribution are\nthe much larger weight for small relative heights and the divergence at zero\nheight for alpha>3. We also demonstrate that the boundary conditions affect the\nshape of the distribution by presenting exact results for some non-periodic\nboundary conditions. Finally, we show that, for signals arising from\ntime-translationally invariant distributions, the density of near extreme\nstates is the same as the MRH_I distribution. This is used in developing a\nscaling theory for the threshold singularities of the two distributions.\n",

        "abstract": "  We first summarize the classical arguments that the vast majority of\nglass-forming liquids require more than one \"order\" parameter for their\ndescription. Critiques against this conventional wisdom are then presented, and\nit is argued that the matter deserves to be reconsidered in light of recent\nexperimental developments. Out of the eight basic thermoviscoelastic\nfrequency-dependent response functions, there are generally three independent\nfunctions. For stochastic dynamics we show that there are only two independent\nresponse functions; for this case it is shown how analytic continuation may be\nutilized to express the third response functions in terms of two others.\nOperational criteria are presented for the linear thermoviscoelasticity being\ndescribed by a single \"order\" parameter, in which case there is just one\nindependent thermoviscoelastic response function. It is shown that a single\n\"order\" parameter description applies to a good approximation whenever thermal\nequilibrium fluctuations of fundamental variables like energy and pressure are\nstrongly correlated. Results from computer simulations showing that this is the\ncase for a number of simple glass-forming liquids, as well as a few exceptions,\nare briefly presented. Finally, we discuss a new conjecture according to which\nexperiments at varying temperature and pressure follow the density-scaling\nexpression for the relaxation time, $\\tau=F(\\rho^x/T)$ ($\\rho$ and $T$ are\ndensity and temperature), if and only if the liquid is \"strongly correlating,\"\ni.e., to a good approximation is described by a single \"order\" parameter.\n",

        "abstract": "  Recent likelihood theory produces $p$-values that have remarkable accuracy\nand wide applicability. The calculations use familiar tools such as maximum\nlikelihood values (MLEs), observed information and parameter rescaling. The\nusual evaluation of such $p$-values is by simulations, and such simulations do\nverify that the global distribution of the $p$-values is uniform(0, 1), to high\naccuracy in repeated sampling. The derivation of the $p$-values, however,\nasserts a stronger statement, that they have a uniform(0, 1) distribution\nconditionally, given identified precision information provided by the data. We\ntake a simple regression example that involves exact precision information and\nuse large sample techniques to extract highly accurate information as to the\nstatistical position of the data point with respect to the parameter:\nspecifically, we examine various $p$-values and Bayesian posterior survivor\n$s$-values for validity. With observed data we numerically evaluate the various\n$p$-values and $s$-values, and we also record the related general formulas. We\nthen assess the numerical values for accuracy using Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(McMC) methods. We also propose some third-order likelihood-based procedures\nfor obtaining means and variances of Bayesian posterior distributions, again\nfollowed by McMC assessment. Finally we propose some adaptive McMC methods to\nimprove the simulation acceptance rates. All these methods are based on\nasymptotic analysis that derives from the effect of additional data. And the\nmethods use simple calculations based on familiar maximizing values and related\ninformations. The example illustrates the general formulas and the ease of\ncalculations, while the McMC assessments demonstrate the numerical validity of\nthe $p$-values as percentage position of a data point. The example, however, is\nvery simple and transparent, and thus gives little indication that in a wide\ngenerality of models the formulas do accurately separate information for almost\nany parameter of interest, and then do give accurate $p$-value determinations\nfrom that information. As illustration an enigmatic problem in the literature\nis discussed and simulations are recorded; various examples in the literature\nare cited.\n",

A large sample of reliable input\ndata from nuclear bulk properties (energy, radii, surface thickness) is\nselected guided by the criterion that ground-state correlations should remain\nsmall. Least squares fitting techniques are used to determine the SHF\nparameters which accommodate best the given input data. The question of the\npredictive value of the adjustment is scrutinized by performing systematic\nvariations with respect to chosen nuclear matter properties (incompressibility,\neffective mass, symmetry energy, and sum-rule enhancement factor). We find that\nthe ground-state data, although representing a large sample, leave a broad\nrange of choices, i.e. a broad range of nuclear matter properties. Information\nfrom giant resonances is added to pin down more precisely the open features. We\nthen apply the set of newly adjusted parameterizations to several more detailed\nobservables such as neutron skin, isotope shifts, and super-heavy elements. The\ntechniques of least-squares fitting provide safe estimates for the\nuncertainties of such extrapolations. The systematic variation of forces allows\nto disentangle the various influences on a given observable and to estimate the\npredictive value of the SHF model.

As a demonstration we present numerical results for the\nextraction of ground state and excited B-meson masses and decay constants in\nstatic approximation and to order $1/m_b$ in HQET.\n",

The trace formulae depend on a parameter w which can be tuned\ncontinuously to assign different weights to different periodic orbit\ncontributions. At the special value w=1, the only periodic orbits which\ncontribute are the non back- scattering orbits, and the smooth part in the\ntrace formula coincides with the Kesten-McKay expression. As w deviates from\nunity, non vanishing weights are assigned to the periodic walks with\nback-scatter, and the smooth part is modified in a consistent way. The trace\nformulae presented here are the tools to be used in the second paper in this\nsequence, for showing the connection between the spectral properties of\nd-regular graphs and the theory of random matrices.\n",

        "abstract": "  We complete the existing literature on the kinetic theory of systems with\nlong-range interactions. Starting from the BBGKY hierarchy, or using projection\noperator technics or a quasilinear theory, a general kinetic equation can be\nderived when collective effects are neglected. This equation (which is not\nwell-known) applies to possibly spatially inhomogeneous systems, which is\nspecific to systems with long-range interactions. Interestingly, the structure\nof this kinetic equation bears a clear physical meaning in terms of generalized\nKubo relations. Furthermore, this equation takes a very similar form for\nstellar systems and two-dimensional point vortices providing therefore a\nunified description of the kinetic theory of these systems. If we assume that\nthe system is spatially homogeneous (or axisymmetric for point vortices), this\nequation can be simplified and reduces to the Landau equation (or its\ncounterpart for point vortices). Our formalism thus offers a simple derivation\nof Landau-type equations. We also use this general formalism to derive a\nkinetic equation, written in angle-action variables, describing spatially\ninhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions. This new derivation solves\nthe shortcomings of our previous derivation [P.H. Chavanis, Physica A 377, 469\n(2007)]. Finally, we consider a test particle approach and derive general\nexpressions for the diffusion and friction (or drift) coefficients of a test\nparticle evolving in a bath of field particles. We make contact with the\nexpressions previously obtained in the literature. As an application of the\nkinetic theory, we argue that the relaxation time is shorter for inhomogeneous\n(or high-dimensional) systems than for homogeneous (or low-dimensional) systems\nbecause there are potentially more resonances.\n",

Examination of the power spectrum over a range of frequencies (10 -\n15 year^-1) appropriate for solar synodic rotation rates reveals several\nperiodicities, the most prominent being one at 11.18 year^-1 with power 20.76.\nWe evaluate the significance of this peak in terms of the false-alarm\nprobability, by means of the shuffle test, and also by means of a new test (the\n\"shake\" test) that involves small random time displacements. The last two tests\nindicate that the peak at 11.18 year^-1 would arise by chance only once out of\nabout 10^7 trials. Since there are several peaks in the search band, we also\ninvestigate the running mean of the power spectrum, and identify a major peak\nat 11.93 year^-1 with peak running-mean power 4.08. Application of the shuffle\ntest and the shake test indicates that there is less than one chance in 10^11,\nand one chance in 10^15, respectively, finding by chance a value as large as\n4.08.\n",

This machinery is used to derive eigenvalue analogues of the\nclassical Chernoff, Bennett, and Bernstein bounds.\n  Two examples demonstrate the efficacy of the minimax Laplace transform. The\nfirst concerns the effects of column sparsification on the spectrum of a matrix\nwith orthonormal rows. Here, the behavior of the singular values can be\ndescribed in terms of coherence-like quantities. The second example addresses\nthe question of relative accuracy in the estimation of eigenvalues of the\ncovariance matrix of a random process. Standard results on the convergence of\nsample covariance matrices provide bounds on the number of samples needed to\nobtain relative accuracy in the spectral norm, but these results only guarantee\nrelative accuracy in the estimate of the maximum eigenvalue. The minimax\nLaplace transform argument establishes that if the lowest eigenvalues decay\nsufficiently fast, on the order of (K^2*r*log(p))/eps^2 samples, where K is the\ncondition number of an optimal rank-r approximation to C, are sufficient to\nensure that the dominant r eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a N(0, C)\nrandom vector are estimated to within a factor of 1+-eps with high probability.\n",

This term introduces a wave function gradient,\nwhose coefficient is real and position dependent, and which represents a\nnonlocality. We pay special attention to the prominent backscattering minima\nwhich depend sensitively on the incident energies, and which are a tell-tale of\nnonlocalities. Reasonable fits to the analyzing power data are also obtained as\na by-product. All our potentials have the form of conventional Woods - Saxon\nshapes or their derivatives. The number of our parameters (12) is smaller than\nthe number for other local optical potentials, and they vary monotically with\nenergy, while the strengths of the real and imaginary parts of the central\npotential are nearly constants. Our nonlocality is in contrast to other forms\nof nonlocalities introduced previously.\n",

We illustrate the power of the {\\sl covariance analysis} by\nusing two relativistic mean-field models: (a) the original linear Walecka model\nand (b) the accurately calibrated FSUGold parametrization. In addition to\nproviding meaningful theoretical uncertainties for both model parameters and\npredicted observables, the covariance analysis establishes robust correlations\nbetween physical observables. In particular, we show that whereas the\ncorrelation coefficient between the slope of the symmetry energy and the\nneutron-skin thickness of Lead is indeed very large, a 1% measurement of the\nneutron radius of Lead may only be able to constrain the slope of the symmetry\nenergy to about 30%.\n",

Section 2 centers on Figure 2, which\norganizes a wide class of priors on the unknown Level-II hyperparameters that\nhave been proved to yield admissible Model-I minimax shrinkage estimators in\nthe \"equal variance case.\" Putting a flat prior on the Level-II variance is\nunique in this class for its scale-invariance and for its conjugacy, and it\ninduces Stein's harmonic prior (SHP) on $\\mu_i$.\n",

Of great interest are not only the best\nfit values of these constants but also their errors. Some of the neutrino\noscillation data is statistically poor and cannot be treated by normal\n(Gaussian) statistics. To extract confidence intervals when the statistics are\nnot normal, one should not utilize the value for chisquare versus confidence\nlevel taken from normal statistics. Instead, we propose that one should use the\nnormalized likelihood function as a probability distribution; the relationship\nbetween the correct chisquare and a given confidence level can be computed by\nintegrating over the likelihood function. This allows for a definition of\nconfidence level independent of the functional form of the !2 function; it is\nparticularly useful for cases in which the minimum of the !2 function is near a\nboundary. We present two pedagogic examples and find that the proposed method\nyields confidence intervals that can differ significantly from those obtained\nby using the value of chisquare from normal statistics. For example, we find\nthat for the first data release of the T2K experiment the probability that\nchisquare is not zero, as defined by the maximum confidence level at which the\nvalue of zero is not allowed, is 92%. Using the value of chisquare at zero and\nassigning a confidence level from normal statistics, a common practice, gives\nthe over estimation of 99.5%.\n",

        "title": "An Introduction to the Quantum Backflow Effect",
        "abstract": "  We present an introduction to the backflow effect in quantum mechanics -- the\nphenomenon in which a state consisting entirely of positive momenta may have\nnegative current and the probability flows in the opposite direction to the\nmomentum. We show that the effect is present even for simple states consisting\nof superpositions of gaussian wave packets, although the size of the effect is\nsmall. Inspired by the numerical results of Penz et al, we present a wave\nfunction whose current at any time may be computed analytically and which has\nperiods of significant backflow, with a backwards flux equal to about 70\npercent of the maximum possible backflow, a dimensionless number $c_{bm}\n\\approx 0.04 $, discovered by Bracken and Melloy. This number has the unusual\nproperty of being independent of $\\hbar$ (and also of all other parameters of\nthe model), despite corresponding to a quantum-mechanical effect, and we shed\nsome light on this surprising property by considering the classical limit of\nbackflow. We conclude by discussing a specific measurement model in which\nbackflow may be identified in certain measurable probabilities.\n",

        "abstract": "  Current methods for learning graphical models with latent variables and a\nfixed structure estimate optimal values for the model parameters. Whereas this\napproach usually produces overfitting and suboptimal generalization\nperformance, carrying out the Bayesian program of computing the full posterior\ndistributions over the parameters remains a difficult problem. Moreover,\nlearning the structure of models with latent variables, for which the Bayesian\napproach is crucial, is yet a harder problem. In this paper I present the\nVariational Bayes framework, which provides a solution to these problems. This\napproach approximates full posterior distributions over model parameters and\nstructures, as well as latent variables, in an analytical manner without\nresorting to sampling methods. Unlike in the Laplace approximation, these\nposteriors are generally non-Gaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. The\nresulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization\nalgorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. I demonstrate that this algorithm\ncan be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including\nunsupervised clustering and blind source separation.\n",

The first sections are an abridgment of parts of the\nbook by Marsden and Hughes, including a compact identification of the equations\nof motion as the Euler-Lagrange equations for the lagrangian density. The other\nsections describe the basic first-order classification of materials, from the\npoint of view of representation theory as opposed to index calculus. It\nincludes a computation of the axes of symmetry, when they exist, for most of\nthe irreducible components of the elasticity tensor. When the two components of\nthe 5-dimensional type $V_5$ have axes of symmetry, some invariants appear: 2\nangles in $S^{1}$ that measure the deviation of an associated decomposition\n$V_5\\otimes \\mathbb{R}^2=V_5\\oplus V_5$ from the standard one. See also the\nclassification appearing for example in (Chadwick, Vianello, and Cowin) and\n(Bona, Bucataru, and Slawinski) by symmetry group in $SO(3)$. A somewhat more\nrepresentation-theoretic approach can be found in (Itin and Hehl), and a\ncomplete list of polynomial invariants for generic elasticity tensors can be\nfound in (Boehler, Kirillov Jr, and Onat).\n",

        "abstract": "  A new variational method, the principle of least radix economy, is\nformulated. The mathematical and physical relevance of the radix economy, also\ncalled digit capacity, is established, showing how physical laws can be derived\nfrom this concept in a unified way. The principle reinterprets and generalizes\nthe principle of least action yielding two classes of physical solutions: least\naction paths and quantum wavefunctions. A new physical foundation of the\nHilbert space of quantum mechanics is then accomplished and it is used to\nderive the Schr\\\"odinger and Dirac equations and the breaking of the\ncommutativity of spacetime geometry. The formulation provides an explanation of\nhow determinism and random statistical behavior coexist in spacetime and a\nframework is developed that allows dynamical processes to be formulated in\nterms of chains of digits. These methods lead to a new (pre-geometrical)\nfoundation for Lorentz transformations and special relativity. The\nParker-Rhodes combinatorial hierarchy is encompassed within our approach and\nthis leads to an estimate of the interaction strength of the electromagnetic\nand gravitational forces that agrees with the experimental values to an error\nof less than one thousandth. Finally, it is shown how the principle of\nleast-radix economy naturally gives rise to Boltzmann's principle of classical\nstatistical thermodynamics. A new expression for a general (path-dependent)\nnonequilibrium entropy is proposed satisfying the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n",
