        "abstract": "  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classical method for dimensionality\nreduction based on extracting the dominant eigenvectors of the sample\ncovariance matrix. However, PCA is well known to behave poorly in the ``large\n$p$, small $n$'' setting, in which the problem dimension $p$ is comparable to\nor larger than the sample size $n$. This paper studies PCA in this\nhigh-dimensional regime, but under the additional assumption that the maximal\neigenvector is sparse, say, with at most $k$ nonzero components. We consider a\nspiked covariance model in which a base matrix is perturbed by adding a\n$k$-sparse maximal eigenvector, and we analyze two computationally tractable\nmethods for recovering the support set of this maximal eigenvector, as follows:\n(a) a simple diagonal thresholding method, which transitions from success to\nfailure as a function of the rescaled sample size\n$\\theta_{\\mathrm{dia}}(n,p,k)=n/[k^2\\log(p-k)]$; and (b) a more sophisticated\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which succeeds once the rescaled\nsample size $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)=n/[k\\log(p-k)]$ is larger than a\ncritical threshold. In addition, we prove that no method, including the best\nmethod which has exponential-time complexity, can succeed in recovering the\nsupport if the order parameter $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)$ is below a\nthreshold. Our results thus highlight an interesting trade-off between\ncomputational and statistical efficiency in high-dimensional inference.\n",

We consider here fuzzy constraint problems\nwhere some of the preferences may be missing. This models, for example,\nsettings where agents are distributed and have privacy issues, or where there\nis an ongoing preference elicitation process. In this setting, we study how to\nfind a solution which is optimal irrespective of the missing preferences. In\nthe process of finding such a solution, we may elicit preferences from the user\nif necessary. However, our goal is to ask the user as little as possible. We\ndefine a combined solving and preference elicitation scheme with a large number\nof different instantiations, each corresponding to a concrete algorithm which\nwe compare experimentally. We compute both the number of elicited preferences\nand the \"user effort\", which may be larger, as it contains all the preference\nvalues the user has to compute to be able to respond to the elicitation\nrequests. While the number of elicited preferences is important when the\nconcern is to communicate as little information as possible, the user effort\nmeasures also the hidden work the user has to do to be able to communicate the\nelicited preferences. Our experimental results show that some of our algorithms\nare very good at finding a necessarily optimal solution while asking the user\nfor only a very small fraction of the missing preferences. The user effort is\nalso very small for the best algorithms. Finally, we test these algorithms on\nhard constraint problems with possibly missing constraints, where the aim is to\nfind feasible solutions irrespective of the missing constraints.\n",

Capacity, robustness and invisibility are important parameters\nin information hiding and are quite difficult to achieve in a single algorithm.\nThis paper proposes a novel steganography technique for digital color image\nwhich achieves the purported targets. The professed methodology employs a\ncomplete random scheme for pixel selection and embedding of data. Of the three\ncolour channels (Red, Green, Blue) in a given colour image, the least two\nsignificant bits of any one of the channels of the color image is used to\nchannelize the embedding capacity of the remaining two channels. We have\ndevised three approaches to achieve various levels of our desired targets. In\nthe first approach, Red is the default guide but it results in localization of\nMSE in the remaining two channels, which makes it slightly vulnerable. In the\nsecond approach, user gets the liberty to select the guiding channel (Red,\nGreen or Blue) to guide the remaining two channels. It will increase the\nrobustness and imperceptibility of the embedded image however the MSE factor\nwill still remain as a drawback. The third approach improves the performance\nfactor as a cyclic methodology is employed and the guiding channel is selected\nin a cyclic fashion. This ensures the uniform distribution of MSE, which gives\nbetter robustness and imperceptibility along with enhanced embedding capacity.\nThe imperceptibility has been enhanced by suitably adapting optimal pixel\nadjustment process (OPAP) on the stego covers.\n",

This high assurance in AES is\ngiven by its resistance to ten years of extensive cryptanalysis, that has shown\nno weakness, not even any deviation from the statistical behaviour expected\nfrom a random permutation. Only reduced versions of the ciphers have been\nbroken, but they are not usually implemented. In this paper we build a\ndistinguishing attack on the AES, exploiting the properties of a novel cipher\nembedding. With our attack we give some statistical evidence that the set of\nAES-$128$ encryptions acts on the message space in a way significantly\ndifferent than that of the set of random permutations acting on the same space.\nWhile we feel that more computational experiments by independent third parties\nare needed in order to validate our statistical results, we show that the\nnon-random behaviour is the same as we would predict using the property of our\nembedding. Indeed, the embedding lowers the nonlinearity of the AES rounds and\ntherefore the AES encryptions tend, on average, to keep low the rank of\nlow-rank matrices constructed in the large space. Our attack needs $2^{23}$\nplaintext-ciphertext pairs and costs the equivalent of $2^{48}$ encryptions.\n  We expect our attack to work also for AES-$192$ and AES-$256$, as confirmed\nby preliminary experiments.\n",

        "title": "Collective Animal Behavior from Bayesian Estimation and Probability\n  Matching",
        "abstract": "  Animals living in groups make movement decisions that depend, among other\nfactors, on social interactions with other group members. Our present\nunderstanding of social rules in animal collectives is mainly based on\nempirical fits to observations, with less emphasis in obtaining\nfirst-principles approaches that allow their derivation. Here we show that\npatterns of collective decisions can be derived from the basic ability of\nanimals to make probabilistic estimations in the presence of uncertainty. We\nbuild a decision-making model with two stages: Bayesian estimation and\nprobabilistic matching. In the first stage, each animal makes a Bayesian\nestimation of which behavior is best to perform taking into account personal\ninformation about the environment and social information collected by observing\nthe behaviors of other animals. In the probability matching stage, each animal\nchooses a behavior with a probability equal to the Bayesian-estimated\nprobability that this behavior is the most appropriate one. This model derives\nvery simple rules of interaction in animal collectives that depend only on two\ntypes of reliability parameters, one that each animal assigns to the other\nanimals and another given by the quality of the non-social information. We test\nour model by obtaining theoretically a rich set of observed collective patterns\nof decisions in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a shoaling\nfish species. The quantitative link shown between probabilistic estimation and\ncollective rules of behavior allows a better contact with other fields such as\nforaging, mate selection, neurobiology and psychology, and gives predictions\nfor experiments directly testing the relationship between estimation and\ncollective behavior.\n",

(2)\nFor the case of no-argument and single-argument parametrized random variables\nwhere the grounding is not polynomial in a population size, we present lifted\ninference which is polynomial in the population size whereas grounding is\nexponential.

It is\nthe responsibility of the coloring algorithm to ensure that interfering nodes\ndo not have the same color. In this research report, we focus on wireless\nsensor networks with grid topologies. How does a coloring algorithm take\nadvantage of the regularity of grid topology to provide an optimal periodic\ncoloring, that is a coloring with the minimum number of colors? We propose the\nVector-Based Coloring Method, denoted VCM, a new method that is able to provide\nan optimal periodic coloring for any radio transmission range and for any h-hop\ncoloring, h>=1. This method consists in determining at which grid nodes a color\ncan be reproduced without creating interferences between these nodes while\nminimizing the number of colors used. We compare the number of colors provided\nby VCM with the number of colors obtained by a distributed coloring algorithm\nwith line and column priority assignments. We also provide bounds on the number\nof colors of optimal general colorings of the infinite grid, and show that\nperiodic colorings (and thus VCM) are asymptotically optimal. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applicability of this method to a real wireless network.\n",

        "title": "Reversed Space Attacks",
        "abstract": "  Many quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes are based on sending and\nmeasuring qubits -- two-dimensional quantum systems. Yet, in practical\nrealizations and experiments, the measuring devices at the receiver's (Bob)\nsite commonly do not measure a two-dimensional system but rather a quantum\nspace of a larger dimension. Such an enlargement sometimes results from\nimperfect devices. However, in various QKD protocols such enlargement exists\neven in the ideal scenario when all devices are assumed to be perfect. This\nissue is common, for instance, in QKD schemes implemented via photons, where\nthe parties' devices are based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, as these\ninherently enlarge the quantum space in use.\n  We show how space enlargement at Bob's site exposes the implemented protocol\nto new kinds of attacks, attacks that have not yet been explicitly pinpointed\nnor rigorously analyzed. We name these the \"reversed space attacks\". A key\ninsight in formalizing our attacks, is the idea of taking all states defining\nBob's (large) measured space and reversing them in time in order to identify\nprecisely the space that an eavesdropper may attack. We employ such attacks on\ntwo variants of intereferometric-based QKD recently experimented by several\ngroups, and show how to get full information on the qubit sent by Alice, while\ninducing no errors at all. The technique we develop here has subsequently been\nused in a closely related work (Boyer, Gelles, and Mor, Physical Review A,\n2014) to demonstrate a (weaker variant of) reversed-space attack on both\ninterferometric-based and polarization-based QKD.\n",

        "abstract": "  Adaptation to changing environments is a hallmark of biological systems.\nDiversity in traits is necessary for adaptation and can influence the survival\nof a population faced with novelty. In habitats that remain stable over many\ngenerations, stabilizing selection reduces trait differences within\npopulations, thereby appearing to remove the diversity needed for heritable\nadaptive responses in new environments. Paradoxically, field studies have\ndocumented numerous populations under long periods of stabilizing selection and\nevolutionary stasis that have rapidly evolved under changed environmental\nconditions. In this article, we review how cryptic genetic variation (CGV)\nresolves this diversity paradox by allowing populations in a stable environment\nto gradually accumulate hidden genetic diversity that is revealed as trait\ndifferences when environments change. Instead of being in conflict,\nenvironmental stasis supports CGV accumulation and thus appears to facilitate\nrapid adaptation in new environments as suggested by recent CGV studies.\nSimilarly, degeneracy has been found to support both genetic and non-genetic\nadaptation at many levels of biological organization. Degenerate, as opposed to\ndiverse or redundant, ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain\nenvironmental contexts but functionally diverse in others. CGV and degeneracy\nparadigms for adaptation are integrated in this review, revealing a common set\nof principles that support adaptation at multiple levels of biological\norganization. Though a discussion of simulation studies, molecular-based\nexperimental systems, principles from population genetics, and field\nexperiments, we demonstrate that CGV and degeneracy reflect complementary\ntop-down and bottom-up, respectively, conceptualizations of the same basic\nphenomenon and arguably capture a universal feature of biological adaptive\nprocesses.\n",

However, when precoding techniques are\nutilized to obtain multi-antenna gains, the system generally requires channel\nstate information (CSI) at the transmitters. We consider a linear precoding\nscheme in a MIMO relaying broadcast channel with quantized CSI feedback from\nboth two-hop links. With this scheme, each remote user feeds back its quantized\nCSI to the relay, and the relay sends back the quantized precoding information\nto the base station (BS). An upper bound on the rate loss due to quantized\nchannel knowledge is first characterized. Then, in order to maintain the rate\nloss within a predetermined gap for growing SNRs, a strategy of scaling\nquantization quality of both two-hop links is proposed. It is revealed that the\nnumbers of feedback bits of both links should scale linearly with the transmit\npower at the relay, while only the bit number of feedback from the relay to the\nBS needs to grow with the increasing transmit power at the BS. Numerical\nresults are provided to verify the proposed strategy for feedback quality\ncontrol.\n",

Instrumentation and measurement\ntechnology is, by and large, keeping pace with this development and growth.\nHowever, the algorithms, tools, and technology required to transform the data\ninto relevant information for decision making are not. The claim in this paper\n(and the invited talk) is that the line of research conducted in Uncertainty in\nArtificial Intelligence is very well suited to address the challenges and close\nthis gap. I will support this claim and discuss open problems using recent\nexamples in diagnosis, model discovery, and policy optimization on three real\nlife distributed systems.\n",

They can be used to define prior distributions over latent functions\nin hierarchical Bayesian models. The prior over functions is defined implicitly\nby the mean and covariance function, which determine the smoothness and\nvariability of the function. The inference can then be conducted directly in\nthe function space by evaluating or approximating the posterior process.\nDespite their attractive theoretical properties GPs provide practical\nchallenges in their implementation. GPstuff is a versatile collection of\ncomputational tools for GP models compatible with Linux and Windows MATLAB and\nOctave.

To position our discussion\nwithin the ongoing debate on uncertainty, we provide a brief review of\nhistorical developments in economic theory and decision theory on the\ndescription of economic agents' choice behaviour under conditions of\nuncertainty, understood as either (i) ambiguity, or (ii) unawareness.\nAccordingly, we identify and discuss two approaches to the formalisation of\nnon-knowledge: one based on decision-making in the context of a state space\nrepresenting the exogenous world, as in Savage's axiomatisation and some\nsuccessor concepts (ambiguity as situations with unknown probabilities), and\none based on decision-making over a set of menus of potential future\nopportunities, providing the possibility of derivation of agents' subjective\nstate spaces (unawareness as situation with imperfect subjective knowledge of\nall future events possible).

We first formalize LT^2C^2, giving its syntax and\nsemantics and defining an adequate notion of program size. Our setting leads to\na Kolmogorov complexity function relative to LT^2C^2 which is computable in\npolynomial time, and it also induces a prediction algorithm in the spirit of\nSolomonoff's inductive inference theory. We then prove the efficacy of this\nlanguage by investigating regularities in strings produced by participants\nattempting to generate random strings. Participants had a profound\nunderstanding of randomness and hence avoided typical misconceptions such as\nexaggerating the number of alternations. We reasoned that remaining\nregularities would express the algorithmic nature of human thoughts, revealed\nin the form of specific patterns. Kolmogorov complexity relative to LT^2C^2\npassed three expected tests examined here: 1) human sequences were less complex\nthan control PRNG sequences, 2) human sequences were not stationary, showing\ndecreasing values of complexity resulting from fatigue, 3) each individual\nshowed traces of algorithmic stability since fitting of partial sequences was\nmore effective to predict subsequent sequences than average fits.

In this paper, we present\nthe first prototype of a graphical user interface (GUI) for the new system. It\nheavily relies on powerful interactive capabilities introduced in recent\nreleases of the underlying Mathematica system, most importantly the possibility\nof having dynamic objects connected to interface elements like sliders, menus,\ncheck-boxes, radio-buttons and the like. All these features are fully\nintegrated into the Mathematica programming environment and allow the\nimplementation of a modern user interface.\n",

LDAGs generalize earlier proposals for\nallowing local structures in the conditional probability distribution of a\nnode, such that unrestricted label sets determine which edges can be deleted\nfrom the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) for a given context. Several\nproperties of these models are derived, including a generalization of the\nconcept of Markov equivalence classes. Efficient Bayesian learning of LDAGs is\nenabled by introducing an LDAG-based factorization of the Dirichlet prior for\nthe model parameters, such that the marginal likelihood can be calculated\nanalytically. In addition, we develop a novel prior distribution for the model\nstructures that can appropriately penalize a model for its labeling complexity.\nA non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm combined with a greedy hill\nclimbing approach is used for illustrating the useful properties of LDAG models\nfor both real and synthetic data sets.\n",

        "title": "Learning Hidden Structures with Relational Models by Adequately\n  Involving Rich Information in A Network",
        "abstract": "  Effectively modelling hidden structures in a network is very practical but\ntheoretically challenging. Existing relational models only involve very limited\ninformation, namely the binary directional link data, embedded in a network to\nlearn hidden networking structures. There is other rich and meaningful\ninformation (e.g., various attributes of entities and more granular information\nthan binary elements such as \"like\" or \"dislike\") missed, which play a critical\nrole in forming and understanding relations in a network. In this work, we\npropose an informative relational model (InfRM) framework to adequately involve\nrich information and its granularity in a network, including metadata\ninformation about each entity and various forms of link data. Firstly, an\neffective metadata information incorporation method is employed on the prior\ninformation from relational models MMSB and LFRM. This is to encourage the\nentities with similar metadata information to have similar hidden structures.\nSecondly, we propose various solutions to cater for alternative forms of link\ndata. Substantial efforts have been made towards modelling appropriateness and\nefficiency, for example, using conjugate priors. We evaluate our framework and\nits inference algorithms in different datasets, which shows the generality and\neffectiveness of our models in capturing implicit structures in networks.\n",

        "abstract": "  Online Social Networks (OSNs) have rapidly become a prominent and widely used\nservice, offering a wealth of personal and sensitive information with\nsignificant security and privacy implications. Hence, OSNs are also an\nimportant - and popular - subject for research. To perform research based on\nreal-life evidence, however, researchers may need to access OSN data, such as\ntexts and files uploaded by users and connections among users. This raises\nsignificant ethical problems. Currently, there are no clear ethical guidelines,\nand researchers may end up (unintentionally) performing ethically questionable\nresearch, sometimes even when more ethical research alternatives exist. For\nexample, several studies have employed `fake identities` to collect data from\nOSNs, but fake identities may be used for attacks and are considered a security\nissue. Is it legitimate to use fake identities for studying OSNs or for\ncollecting OSN data for research? We present a taxonomy of the ethical\nchallenges facing researchers of OSNs and compare different approaches. We\ndemonstrate how ethical considerations have been taken into account in previous\nstudies that used fake identities. In addition, several possible approaches are\noffered to reduce or avoid ethical misconducts. We hope this work will\nstimulate the development and use of ethical practices and methods in the\nresearch of online social networks.\n",

Statistical tests are thus not sufficient to guarantee that an RNG\nis usable for applications, e.g., in cryptography or gambling, where\nunpredictability is important. To enable such applications a stronger notion of\nrandomness, termed \"true randomness\", is required, which includes independence\nfrom prior information.\n  Quantum systems are particularly suitable for true randomness generation, as\ntheir unpredictability can be proved based on physical principles. Practical\nimplementations of Quantum RNGs (QRNGs) are however always subject to noise,\ni.e., influences which are not fully controlled. This reduces the quality of\nthe raw randomness generated by the device, making it necessary to post-process\nit. Here we provide a framework to analyse realistic QRNGs and to determine the\npost-processing that is necessary to turn their raw output into true\nrandomness.\n",
